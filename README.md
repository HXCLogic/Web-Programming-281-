**Assignment 2: Form Validation**

The task involves recreating a specific form layout and implementing validation mechanisms to ensure input integrity. The form should be validated for various criteria outlined below.

**Constraints**

* Validation should trigger when users move focus between fields.
* First Name and Last Name accept only alphabetic characters.
* User ID and Reference Code accept any valid string.
* Drop-down menus should offer at least three valid options and a default invalid option.
* Utilize icons and visual effects to enhance validation feedback.
* Invalid fields should be indicated upon submission of the form (sticky form behavior).
* Upon successful submission, display a summary of entered information without showing the form again.
